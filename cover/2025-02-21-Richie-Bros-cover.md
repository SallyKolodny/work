Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Lead IT Support Centre Associate role at Richie Brothers. With over two decades of hands-on IT experience I believe I would be a tremendous asset to the organization. I have extensive tier 1 and tier 2 support experience as well as experience managing support teams. In my previous roles, e.g. Morgan Stanley, CIBC and BMO I provided support via phone, email and to people walking up to my desk. I have worked with ServiceNow as a ticketing system as well. 

I am an extremely fast learner, my last manager said I was one of the smartest people he has ever worked with. Unfortunately, when BMO acquired the Bank of the West my consulting position became redundant and I was let go. Since then I have been working on further developing my skill set. In the past year I have setup and am running a Monero XMR cryptocurrency mining operation as a proof-of-concept. I have authored code to monitor the performance, perform ETL tasks and publish near-realtime visualizations to the web. See https://xmr.osoyalce.com/.

I have also tacked Artificial Intelligence and have created a Python PyTorch implementation of an AI training simulator. The simulation environment supports swapping in and out different neural network architectures including basic linear, RNN and CNN architectures. My code also creates a MatPlotLib dashboard which plots scores over time, score distribution and other metrics in realtime as the simulator runs.

I realize that these experiences are not inline with this role's responsibilities. I mention them to provide a sense of my technical strength and depth and ability to learn new technologies rapidly.

I sincerely hope you will give me the opportunity to join your team and put my talent to good use.

      Sincerely,
          Nadim-Daniel Ghaznavi
