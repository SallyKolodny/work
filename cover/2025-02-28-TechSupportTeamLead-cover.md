Dear Sir or Madam,

I was excited to see the posting for a Technical Support Team Lead for Phorest Salson Software. With my extensive experience across multiple industries and domains, I believe I am very well suited for this role. Most of my career has been spent as a Linux Systems expert supporting systems, building out new systems, evaluating new solutions, and/or managing teams.

Much of my IT experience has been as a consultant, which has exposed me to many, many different computing environments. Typically, I have landed in a mess and been tasked with cleaning it up, streamlining operations, and creating an enterprise-grade environment. I have been fortunate to be able to design and build new systems, including monitoring, logging, LDAP, 3-tiered distributed systems, patching, scanning, and more. I have authored code in Perl, PHP, Shell, and Python and supported C and C++ development teams.

I have experience supporting mission-critical systems such as the compliance plant for Merrill Lynch, the payment processing systems for Moneris Solutions, and the FOREX trading platform for CIBC. I have been part of teams and also led teams. I have also built out systems. For example, at Xpedite, I transformed a prototype banking application that was running on a pair of laptops into a fully redundant, clustered, 3-tiered system that I designed and built.

Currently, I am self-employed, working on multiple projects that do not generate any significant income. These include a cryptocurrency mining operation and AI development. I mention these to demonstrate my broad range of skills as well as my undying passion for technology. I hope you will give me the opportunity to lend my diverse experience and skill set to your organization. I know I would be a tremendous asset to your organization, and I hope you will give me the chance to prove it.

At this point in my life, I am looking for something stable, and this position looks perfect. 

   Have a great day,
            Nadim-Daniel
