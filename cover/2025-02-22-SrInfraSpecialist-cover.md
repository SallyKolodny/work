Dear Sir or Madam,

I was excited to see the posting for a Senior Infrastruture Specialist with Canada Life in Toronto. With my extensive experience across multiple industries and domains I believe I am very well suited for this role. Most of my career has been spent as a Linux Systems expert supporting systems, building out new systems and evaluating new solutions.

Much of my IT experience has been as a consultant which has exposed me to many, many different computing environments. Typically, I have landed in a mess and been tasked with cleaning it up, stream-lining operations and creating a enterprise grade environment. I have been fortunate to be able to design and build new systems including monitoring, logging, LDAP, 3-Tiered distributed systems, patching, scanning and more. I have authored code, Perl, PHP, Shell and Python and supported C and C++ development teams.

I have experience supporting mission critical systems such as the compliance plant for Merrill Lynch, the payment processing systems for Moneris Solutions and the FOREX trading platform for CIBC. I have been part of teams and also led teams. My work at Xpedite, transforming a prototype banking application that was running on a pair of laptops into a fully redundant, clustered, 3 tiered system that I designed and built is relevant to this position.

Currently, I am self employed, working on multiple projects that do not generate any significant income. These inlcude a cryptocurrency mining operation and AI development. I mention these to demonstrate my broad range of skills as well as my undying passion for technology. I hope you will give me the opportunity to lend my diverse experience and skill set to your organization. I know I would be a tremendous asset to your teams and I hope you will give me the chance to prove it.

At this point in my life, I am looking for something stable and this position looks perfect. I am currently living in Hamilton, Ontario so a commute to Toronto would not be a problem. In fact I would consider relocating as I have family in Toronto. 

   Have a great day,
            Nadim-Daniel
